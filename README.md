## 🚀 Building the React App

To build the React app, you can use the `npm run build` command. This will create a production-ready build of your app in the `build/` directory.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your React app.
2. Run the `npm run build` command to create a production build of your app. This will generate a static bundle of your app in the `build/` directory.
3. Copy the contents of the `build/` directory to your server's public directory. You can do this using an FTP client or by running a command like `scp` to transfer the files to your server. Make sure to replace `example.com` and `/var/www/html` with your server's domain name and public directory, respectively:

    ```bash
    scp -r build/* user@example.com:/var/www/html
    ```

4. This portfolio app should now be accessible from your server's domain name. You can verify this by opening a web browser and navigating to http://example.com (replace example.com with your server's domain name).
